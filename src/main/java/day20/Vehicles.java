       1)Constructors are used to create an object from a class.
         If there is no constructor, it is impossible to create an object from a class
       2)Java knows classes are for object creations, because of that Java puts "constructor" in every class automatically.
         Constructor coming from Java will be invisible, it is called "default constructor"
         default constructors ==> public Vehicles(){ }
         method               ==>public int add(){ }
       3)Java is jealous, when you create your own constructor Java deletes the default one.
       4)What are the differences between "constructors" and "methods"?
           i)"constructors" are for object creations but "methods" are for some actions
           ii)"constructors" do not have "return type" but "methods" must have
           iii)The name of "constructors" must match with the name of the Class, but "methods" can use any name
