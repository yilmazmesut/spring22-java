            !) Arrays are for storing multiple data
            2) An array can have just a single data type
            3) Arrays can store just primitive data types or references of non-primitives
            When you put a String in an Array, java will put it in the heap memory, and put the references in the stack memory,
            so there is just reference of strings in Array.
                An array cannot have non-primitive data types.
           you can not put wrapper class into a wrapper class,
           4) When you create an Array, you have to declare its length (Number of elements in an Array)
