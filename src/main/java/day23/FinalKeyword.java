        1) "final methods" body cannot be updated cannot be overridden.
        2) If a variable is "final variable" i)You have to initialize it, "final int y;" gives error, it must be like "final int y=12;"
                                             ii)After initializing, the value of the "final variable" cannot be updated
        3) If a class is "final class", it cannot have child classes but "final class" can be a child class.
            i)All wrapper classes are "final classes"
            ii)All immutable classes are "final classes" so String is a final class.
