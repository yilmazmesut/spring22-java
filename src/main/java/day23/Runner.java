           1)super() is used to call constructors from parent class.
             i)If the parent class has multiple constructors by the help of the
             parameters you can select any constructor.
             ii)Typing "super()" is optional but if you use super() with
             parameters you have to type it.
             iii)super() must be in the first line in constructor body.
             iv)super() can be used just once in a constructor body
           2)this() is used to call constructors from the class itself.
             i)If the class has multiple constructors by the help of the
             parameters you can select any constructor.
             ii)Typing "this()" is not optional you have to type it even it has parameter or not.
             iii)this() must be in the first line in constructor body.
             iv)this() can be used just once in a constructor body
             Note: this() and super() cannot be used together in the same constructor body
           3)"super" keyword is used to select any variable or any method from parent class
             "this" keyword is used to select any variable or any method from the class itself
             Note: What is the difference between "this" and "this()"?
                   "this" is used to call variable or methods,
                   "this()" is used to call constructors from the class itself

                   "super" is used to call variable or methods,
                   "super()" is used to call constructors from the parent class
